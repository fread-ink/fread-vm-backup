Backup of the virtualbox boxes and .deb packages needed for compiling fread.ink in case they go offline.

The boxes themselves are in the [releases](https://github.com/fread-ink/fread-vm-backup/releases) section since github does not allow files larger than 100 MB in the repos.

TODO missing .deb files for debian-userland
